Registration System that will have:

1. Login
2. Register
3. Forgot things
4. Quit

What I do NOt know how to do?

Save the information given by the user so whenever the program is ran I can always recall that information.

What is this useful for?

Eventually, I want to build a website that has my projects on it (+ whatever I build in the future), so I can add a profile system using this.
