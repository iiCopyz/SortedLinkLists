For this machine problem you will read in a sequence of non-zero integers, terminated by 0 and store them in a (singly) linked list. In particular you are 
to have two lists one for even integers and one for odd integers. You are to insert the links into the list in such a way that the list is sorted from
smallest to largest at all times. You are to then print out the list. Next you are two merge the two lists into a single sorted list which should be sorted
from smallest to largest. This is to be done by removing links from the even and odd list and inserting them into the merge sorted list. Merging will be
discussed in class and you are to follow the method given in class. You should print out the merged list. Now go through the merged list and remove all of
the nodes with even values. Again print out this list. Finally recycle all of the links.

You MUST write the program by supplying the missing code to the partialprogram supplied.~~
